Karl Marx was targeted for assassination when he met with two Prussian officers in his house in Cologne in 1848. Marx had friends among the German labor unions, and he was considered a threat to the autocrats. Dressed in his bathrobe, he forced the officers out at the point of a revolver, which, it turned out, was not loaded.`,

    `The British once went to war over a sailor's ear. It happened in 1739, when Britain launched hostilities against Spain because a Spanish officer had supposedly sliced off the ear of a ship's captain named Robert Jenkins. Alexander Hamilton and his son, Philip, both died on the same spot, and both during duels. Philip went first, 3 years before his father would be killed in that same field by Aaron Burr.`,

While the city was progressive in its hiring practices, Chicago's female police officers were not allowed to wear uniforms until 1956.

Once there, the fungus waits until exactly solar noon to force the ant to bite a leaf and wait for death.`,

`If the Earth's time zones were each one hour apart, then we would have 24 times zones, which sounds pretty straightforward. However, the situation is a little more complicated than that.

`You might think that it's just fish that have gills, but there are several species of sea snake that breathe through their skin as well. For example, the Hydrophis cyanocinctus has been found to breathe through the top of its own head.

`Talk about having to go! Wood frogs in Alaska have been known to hold their urine for up to eight months, sticking it out through the region's long winters before relieving themselves once temperatures increase.

`When we breathe in and out of our nose during the day, one nostril does most of the work at a time, with the duties switching every several hours.

`Bill Murray is famous for starring in movies like the original Ghostbusters (1984) and Groundhog Day (1993). But anyone in Hollywood who's interested in working with him must first navigate a somewhat strange situation in order to get his attention.

`In 2012, Adolf Hitler's medical documents were being auctioned to the public by Alexander Historical Auctions. According to the files, The Telegraph reported, flatulence had become such a pervasive issue for Hitler that he had to regularly ingest 28 different drugs to keep it under control. But some of the anti-gas pills he used contained a base of strychnine, a poison that caused further stomach and liver issues.`,

`As they say, "nothing is certain but death and taxes." Depending on where in the world you live, rain may be just as much of an inevitability. And for some Maryland residents, rain and taxes are both inescapable and tied together thanks to the "rain tax," which was passed by the state legislature and signed into law in 2012.`,

`The thought of any creature devouring its babies may be horrific to us, but for some animals, such as certain fish, reptiles, and amphibians, that's not the case, according to 2019 research published in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution. Among these creatures, sacrificing some of their young via cannibalism may be a way to help their other offspring survive when overcrowding becomes a problem.`,

`The original MacGyver series that ran from 1985 until 1992 featured a main character who could fashion pretty much whatever his heart desired with random objects. As a result, we've been using the word "MacGyvered" as an adjective meaning "adapted or improvised in an ingenious or expedient way." And in March 2019, the term was officially added to the Oxford English Dictionary. It only took 34 years!`,

`Have you ever stopped to think where oxygen comes from? Your first thought may be a rainforest, but here's a cool science fact for you: We can thank plant-based marine organisms for all that fresh air, according to the National Oceanic Service.

`Lost land animals may not be able to find their way home, but sea animals might. According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), "there is evidence that some animals, like sea turtles and salmon, have the ability to sense the Earth's magnetic field and can use this sense for navigation."`,

`These creatures are more dynamic than we think. Rats have the ability to "laugh" when tickled. A video from National Geographic demonstrates that rats respond positively to tickling, and they even chase after the researcher's hand in a playful manner.

`Here's a random fact about one of your favorite foods: Bananas contain potassium, and since potassium decays, that makes the yellow fruit slightly radioactive.

`The genes responsible for the most common type of colorblindness are found on the X chromosome, the National Eye Institute explains. Even if women have the genes on one of their two X chromosomes, a properly functioning gene on the other one makes up for that loss. If men inherit the gene on their only X chromosome, they'll become colorblind.`,

`When you're in the mood to play a song or two, you could grab a guitar or sit down at a piano. But for some Massachusetts residents, typewriters are the instruments of choice.

`It's hard to imagine an alphabet that doesn't include A, Z, and every other letter in between. However, around 300 BC, the Roman censor Appius Claudius Caecus had Z removed from the alphabet due to the fact that it wasn't used that much. The letter S was also nixed and the letter G was added. It took another 200 years for Z to make its way back to the end of the alphabet.`,
